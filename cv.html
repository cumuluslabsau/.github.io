          <h2>Profile</h2>
          <p>A no-nonsense, enthusiastic, multi-sector technology leader with a passion for creating systems that innovate and execute way beyond the status quo.</p>
          <p>With depth of experience covering technical strategy, system architecture, software development and delivery, I’m a versatile and effective technologist who adds value across the entire scope of product engineering.</p>
          <p>Throughout a career which has spanned a variety of sectors including health, utilities, classifieds and finance I have worked with fast-paced disruptive businesses where technical excellence and speed of delivery has been key to success. As a strong believer in business and technical agility I have created and lead lean, continuously improving teams with a focus on measurement, learning and tight feedback cycles.</p>
          <p>I am entrepreneurial by nature, creative and have an excellent understanding of the business of technology and commercial thinking to build highly effective systems.</p>

          <h2>Things I believe in</h2>
          <p>Use appropriate technologies for the nature of problem and the phase of product maturity. Sometimes products
          require faster turnaround to explore an opportunity, other times it needs to be rock solid as a foundational
          piece upon which other services / features will be built. These require different approaches and oftentimes
          technologies to be effective.</p>
          <p>Use scripting and automation to provide confidence. Many annoying time-consuming mistakes are done at the
          hands of people hastily trying to do the right thing. Automation in this context removes those manual steps thus
          allowing time to be better focussed on important items and can be broadly applied to include the creation of technical
          environments from local dev to production, data migration and testing functionality.</p>
          <p>Intrinsic motivation is far more effective than extrinsic. Interesting and challenging propblems whose solutions
          yield results that have significant benefit from their use is an amazing motivator. The ability to work with
          driven people who support and challenge fosters innovative and effective teams, workplaces and companies. I've found
          that careful recruitment, focussed attention to colleagues and an embracing of continuous incremental improvement
          to be a formula for creating great outcomes.</p>
          <p>There are many more, but I'll save the balance for a few blog posts in the not too distant future.</p>
